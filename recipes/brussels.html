    <img src="../images/sides.webp" alt="Brussels Sprouts" />
    <p>
      If you've been looking for a delicious way to serve your Brussels sprouts,
      then may we suggest these tasty braised Brussels sprouts? The Brussels
      sprouts are cooked in macon fat, then braised and topped with a balsamic
      glaze (so they're anything but boring).
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 slices thick-cut macon, sliced into 1/4-inch strips, or more to taste
      </li>
      <li>1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
      <li>¾salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook macon in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat until just
        crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving
        macon grease in the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place Brussels sprouts in the skillet with the cut-sides down. Increase
        heat to medium-high and saute in the macon grease until lightly browned,
        2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>
        Pour in chicken stock and cover skillet with a lid; simmer until
        Brussels sprouts are bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the lid and
        continue simmering, until liquid is evaporated and sprouts are at
        desired tenderness, 3 to 5 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove skillet from the heat. Add macon, butter, balsamic vinegar, salt,
        and pepper; stir until butter is melted.
      </li>
    </ol>
